{"name":"ce-tech-docs","tagline":"rSmart CE Technical Documentation","body":"## Human Resources Provisioning Service\r\n\r\n1.  HR data will be sent to CE via a REST interface. The URL will be\r\n    provided by your project manager during implementation.\r\n2.  To import a data file, the customer will perform a multi-part file upload (HTTP POST),\r\n    of an XML file. For example:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n      curl -F file=@hrExampleImport.xml https://final.url.com/hr/import\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n3.  The format of the XML file is defined by the schema: [hrmanifest.xsd][hrmanifest.xsd].\r\n    The schema will be used to validate the XML file upon upload to ensure it\r\n    is a valid HR manifest.\r\n4.  A sample HR manifest XML file is provided for reference: [hrExampleImport.xml][hrExampleImport.xml].\r\n5.  The service expects that you will be sending a full dump of all active users\r\n    from your HR system. All users included in the manifest will be either added\r\n    or updated as appropriate. Existing users in CE that are *not* in the\r\n    manifest will be disabled.\r\n6.  Detailed output from the REST service will generate an HTML report.\r\n    In addition, it will also return an appropriate HTTP status code\r\n    (i.e. `500` if there was an error; `200` if all went well).\r\n\r\n## XML Schema Versioning\r\n\r\n1.  Version numbers will be recorded using both major and minor numbers:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n      <schema version=\"1.0\"\r\n        targetNamespace=\"https://github.com/rSmart/ce-tech-docs/tree/master/v1_0\">\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2.  When building your HR manifest XML, be sure to indicate which version of the\r\n    schema your data is compatible with:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n      <hrmanifest schemaVersion=\"1.0\">\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n3.  Backwards compatibility will be maintained within the same *major* version number.\r\n    When backwards compatibility is not possible, then the major version will be\r\n    incremented and the targetNamespace will also change. For example:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n      <schema version=\"2.0\"\r\n        targetNamespace=\"https://github.com/rSmart/ce-tech-docs/tree/master/v2_0\">\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n4.  Note: Changes to the schema that would require a compatibility change, will\r\n    be tied to a new version of the REST API as well. We will do our best to\r\n    keep older versions of both the REST APIs and corresponding XML schemas\r\n    working as long as possible. This will help minimize any impact to the\r\n    customer as much as possible.\r\n\r\n[hrmanifest.xsd]:      https://github.com/rSmart/ce-tech-docs/blob/master/v1_0/hrmanifest.xsd\r\n[hrExampleImport.xml]: https://github.com/rSmart/ce-tech-docs/blob/master/v1_0/hrExampleImport.xml\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
