The URL will be\r\n   provided by your project manager during implementation.\r\n2. To import a data file, the customer will perform a multi-part file upload (HTTP POST),\r\n   of an XML file to the URL: ```/import```. For example:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n\tcurl -F file=@exampleImport.xml https://final.url.com/hr/import\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. The format of the XML file is defined by the schema: [hrmanifest.xsd][hrmanifest.xsd].\r\n   The schema will be used to validate the XML file upon upload to ensure it\r\n   is a valid HR manifest.\r\n4. A sample HR manifest XML file is provided for reference: [exampleImport.xml][exampleImport.xml].\r\n5. The service expects that you will be sending a full dump of all active users\r\n   from your HR system. All users included in the manifest will be either added\r\n   or updated as appropriate. Existing users in CE that are *not* in the\r\n   manifest will be disabled.\r\n\r\n[hrmanifest.xsd]:    https://github.com/rSmart/CE-tech-docs/blob/master/hrmanifest.xsd\r\n[exampleImport.xml]: https://github.com/rSmart/CE-tech-docs/blob/master/exampleImport.xml\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
